## Key Technical Details

- The Backend have a custom REST API created with Node.js, Express and mongoose schemas of MongoDB.
- For Users authentication of checkout process and Admin Authorization, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used.

## Libraries and Frameworks - Dependencies & DevDependencies

### Backend:

- express (Web Framework to handle routing)
- bcryptjs (Hashing our password to make them secure)
- jsonwebtoken (JWT Authentication to access protective routes on the server)
- express-validator (to validator data in the body like email)
- mongoose (abstraction layer for our DB and to create models)
- nodemon (DevDependency that allow us to keep watching server side changes)
- concurrently (DevDependency that allow us to run backend and frondend at the same time)
- morgan (HTTP request logger middleware for node.js)
- multer (node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.)

### Frontend:

- create-react-app (to install the biolerplate of react)
- axios (library to fetch the http requests and the Custom API)
- @material-ui/core (React UI framework)
- redux (For global state management)
- redux-thunk (to run redux async)

All these dependencies are installed by the Node Package Manager (NPM)

## Database Setup

- For database, I used a MongoDB which is a NoSQL Database (Document Database having JSON format).
- For easy setup, I used MongoDB Atlas which is a cloud database.

Previously, the application was hosted on Heroku with heroku cli. Now both frontend and backend API are hosted separately on Render
